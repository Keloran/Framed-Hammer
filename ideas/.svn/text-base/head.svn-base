This is curretlly taking everythign from you so you dont need todo anything, but this means that any titles have to be in the database, and pulled out specially

if we let the user dictate everything and and take over when it comes to jquery/css then we can have all the custom titles we want since they are dictated by the user

current:
head->getFullHead()

proposed:
head->getTemplate()

standard:
layout	= /layout/head.php
layout	= /layout/templates/head.tpl

which then lets you dictate the head element and parts of it

page specific:
news = /pages/news/head.php
news = /pages/news/templates/head.tpl

if there is a head/tpl then it uses that, otherwise it uses the standard

<!--Page Specific-->
head.php news example:
<?php
$oHead	= $oHammer->getHead();
$oNews	= $oHammer->getNews();
$cTitle	= $oNews->getTitle();

$oHead->setTitle($cTitle);

echo $oHead->renderTemplate();
?>

head.tpl news example:
<!DOCTYPE html>
	<head>
		<title><?php echo $cTitle?></title>
		<?php
			echo $cCSS;
			echo $cJS;
		?>
		<script type="text/javascript">
			var $asda = "News Specific";
		</script>
	</head>
	<body>
	
<!--Standard-->
<?php
$oHead	= $oHammer->getHead();

$oHead->doStandard();

echo $oHead->renderTemplate();
?>

<!DOCTYPE html>
	<head>
		<title><?php echo $cTitle?></title>
		<?php
			echo $cCSS;
			echo $cJS;
		?>
	</head>
	<body>
