There is a set path for actions/choices

<!--reason-->
The reason for this is so that if your doing skinning, filtering, langauges it makes it easier to organise

example:
news	= /pages/news/templates/<filter/skin/language>.tpl

news/comments	= /pages/news/comments/templates/<filter/skin/language>.tpl

news/comments/edit	= /pages/news/comments/edit/templates/<filter/skin/language>.tpl

so if your skin is black, and you have a language
news	= /pages/news/templates/black/english.tpl
news	= /pages/news/templates/black/german.tpl

or would it be better to have it as
news	= /pages/news/templates/english/black/news.tpl
